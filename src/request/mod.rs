//! Module containing all structs modelling requests to the boomlings APIs.
//!
//! These directly implement (de)serialization into RobTop's data format, unlike models where
//! RobTop's eccentricities are hidden. This is since directly re-using these structs outside of
//! making/proxying requests for the boomlings servers seems rather useless to me, as they already
//! contain a lot of boomlings-specific fields.
